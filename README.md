# Earthquake-Prep-Page

This is a webpage created to spead awareness about earthquake safety as well as precautions. There is a simple self report form in the case that you experience an earthquake or any other natural disaster. At the end, there is a page that includes general contact information of government entities in the case the self reporting form is unavailable. Vast addition of CSS was used as well as a bit of javascript for the navbar. Did not include a backend to this site for saving the page or other functons but you are more than welcome to.
