                Created in the 2021, this application was made to spread awareness about natural disaster safety and precautions that everyone should take. Many families do not know what to do when it comes to preparing for a earthquake and many wish they could have done something different that might have prepared them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                That is why this application came along. It contains a vast amount of knowledge from what to do before a disaster, to even during the disaster itself. While many observe reports of earthquakes that were recorded from the USGS, many that experience notice that some of the earthquakes that they experience do not get recorded. That is why we created a self reporting page that allows you to report when you experience an earthquake or other natural disaster. This information is then sent to the USGS to review and record. Your privacy is our number one concern which is why we do not share any private or sensitive information. If, for whatever reason, the reporting page is unavailable, we have included the USGS as well as other similar entities' contact numbers. With this application, we hope to spread awareness about disaster safety and precautions to mitigate risks of injury or death.
